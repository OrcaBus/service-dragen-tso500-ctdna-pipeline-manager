## Introduction

This Pipeline Manager manages the execution of the DRAGEN TSO500 ctDNA pipeline. Here we describe the SOP for manual execution of the pipeline.

## Requirements

- Appropriate AWS permissions
- AWS credentials set up in the local environment
- Tools installed
  - [aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) version 2 or higher
  - [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) version 1.7 or higher
  - [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) version 7.76.0 or higher
  - [semver](https://github.com/fsaintjacques/semver-tool)

## Procedure

To initiate a pipeline execution we need to generate an initial DRAFT event. For more details consult the main [README](../../../../README.md).
For convenience, we provide a shell script that generates and optionally submits an appropriate event.

- Familiarise yourself with the script: [generate-WRU-draft.sh --help](./generate-WRU-draft.sh)
  - Especially check the settings in the `Globals` section
    - ensure the values are fit for your use case, e.g. for clinical samples match the accredited pipeline details
  - Set the engine parameters (if necessary) and library id(s) in the positional arguments.
- Execute the script (e.g. `bash generate-WRU-draft.sh`)
  - Note: AWS credentials need to be set on the environment
  - Use the comment parameter to explain the reason for the manual run, this will be visible in the Portal and helpful for future reference.
- The script should produce the JSON output of the DRAFT event that can be inspected to double check that reflects the intended request
  - Take note of the generated `workflowRunName` or `portalRunId` and the URL to the OrcaBus Portal view of the workflow.
  - You can have the script save the output json file by using the `--save-draft-payload` method.

## Confirmation

The OrcaBus [Portal](https://portal.umccr.org/) can be used to check whether the event resulted in a WorkflowRun record.

- Navigate to the Portal's WorkflowRun listing: https://portal.umccr.org/workflows/workflowRuns
- Search for your WorkflowRun using the `workflowRunName` or `portalRunId`
- Confirm that the WorkflowRun is listed and progressing as expected (check over time)
- Once the WorkflowRun has `SUCCEEDED` the results should be available via the Portal's [Files](https://portal.umccr.org/files) view
  - Simply filter by the `portalRunId`
